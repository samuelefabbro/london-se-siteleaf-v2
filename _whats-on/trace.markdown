The landscape we inhabit has been formed through intervention; man's alterations and nature's adjustments. TRACE shows the work of five artists who work in, from and around landscape. They document and interpret landscape as it shifts and changes, from the eroded coastline of Yorkshire, through the changing rural landscape of Wiltshire to the meanderings of the River Thames and Deptford Creek.
