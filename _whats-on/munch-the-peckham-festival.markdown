Public Artwork: Local artist and co-founder of Asylum – an artist lead space in Peckham, Jo Dennis will produce a series of video “intervention” pieces that engage with the community of Rye Lane and highlight both the cultural diversity and the human unity of Peckham. Inspired in part by Gillian Wearing’s Dancing in Peckham (1994), Jo will film the people of Rye Lane – shop keepers, butchers, delivery men etc. dancing to the music of their choice in their own environment. She will then project this series of films in a space on or near Rye Lane set to one piece of music.
