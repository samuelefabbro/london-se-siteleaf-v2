In collaboration with the London Festival of Architecture, Anise Gallery will be exhibiting works from a select group of leading architectural and documentary photographers. The focus of the exhibition will be the unique and varied landscape of SE1, in particular the multitude of diverse buildings that can be found in this incredible pocket of South East London.

Taking ‘Capital’ as the central theme this year, The London Festival of Architecture will explore the City’s various manifestations, its position as a world capital of architecture being one of them.

Artists confirmed so far include Alexander Christie, Grant Smith, Paul Raftery, John McLean, Luke Hayes, Richard Chivers, Fergus Heron, Brian David Stevens, Jim Stephenson, Marcus Peel, Marc Vallée, Matthew P Wright, Andy Matthews, Shira Gutgold, Agnese Sanvito, Joseph Robson and Nathan Spencer. With this line up the exhibition guarantees to showcase an abundance of incredible photography whilst celebrating the architecture of an historically significant area of an inspiring City. Alongside the photography we will be showing a timelapse video from the respected duo Paul Raftery and Dan Lowe. Taking the landmark Leadenhall Building as their subject, Raftery and Lowe have expertly documented the construction process from start to finish. As the Leadenhall takes its rightful place in enhancing the London skyline, this dynamic and beautiful film records its journey there.
