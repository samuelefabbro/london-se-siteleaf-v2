An exhibition by Deep Sleep founders Justin Barton, Martin Scott-Jupp, Ben Smith and Ian Teh.

Deep Sleep is a online photography magazine founded by and featuring work from a small group of london-based collaborators and showcasing a diverse range of high calibre contemporary photography from emerging young talents in search of an outlet for their work to experienced award-winning and exhibited contributors. There’s no money involved, of course. Not for anyone. In fact, one of our motivations was to do something untainted by the demands of the marketplace. So it is very much a labour of love and we welcome anyone who would like to share in that.

It began as nothing more than an interesting experiment for which the rationale was simple: in the internet age, where anyone with a simple website can make their images instantly available to half the planet, why rely solely on the whims, tastes, judgements and budgets of the few mainstream publications still taking an interest in photography? Some of us were enthusiastic from the start, others verged on apathetic, all of us were preoccupied with the onerous chore of trying to earn a living. But slowly after a long and uncertain gestation, it all of a sudden came to fruition.

Now, with thousands of readers and hundreds of contributors, Deep Sleep is going from strength to strength.

The experiment continues…
