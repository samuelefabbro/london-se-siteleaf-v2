In 2011 British artist Mark Neville spent two months with 16 Air Assault brigade in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. During his time in Helmand Province he was taken out on regular patrols, experiencing the conflict at an unusual, first hand level.

This exhibition showcases a new body of work created in response to the war in Afghanistan. Using techniques such as slow-motion filming with traditional 16mm film to capture rich, grainy colours and textures Neville avoids the familiar images of contemporary conflict.

The slow motion films and large photographic portraits of young Afghan children and British soldiers give an arresting, direct yet poetic view of the British troops and the Afghan people Mark Neville encountered.

Created as part of a unique collaboration between IWM’s Art Commissions Committee and arts organisation firstsite Colchester, this exhibition is part of IWM Contemporary - a programme of contemporary art and photography in response to war and conflict.
