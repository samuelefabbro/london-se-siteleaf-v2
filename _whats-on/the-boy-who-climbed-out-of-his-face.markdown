In this new work, commissioned by The Jetty, shunt are creating a temporary space out of shipping containers, into which 30 people disappear every 10 minutes and are spat out 45 minutes later.

Where was I? Who was that strange man? What was wrong with his face?

I will take you up the back stairs, but I must bandage your eyes ﬁrst, for I never allow people to see those back stairs of mine.

Charles Kingsley, The Water Babies

The last word he pronounced was – your name.

Joseph Conrad, Heart of Darkness

Please note that audience members will be required to remove their shoes and socks on entry

There will be some confined and dark spaces. Those people who experience panic attacks and phobias should be aware.

Suitable for people over 16 years.
