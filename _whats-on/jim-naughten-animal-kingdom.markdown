Collection of mesmerising Natural History images by artist Jim Naughten, brought to three-dimensional life through stereoscopic photography.

The display features 11 pairs of striking photographs of mounted skeletons and wet specimens including a Great Indian Hornbill, an Atlantic White Spotted Octopus, a Red Faced Spider Monkey and a Transparent Chameleon.

Each set is photographed from a right-eye and left-eye perspective which, when viewed with a stereoscopic viewer, gives the illusion of being three-dimensional.

Naughten's photographs are fascinating when viewed in two dimensions but are transformed and brought to life through stereoscopy – a technique developed in the 1800s to create the illusion of viewing images in three dimensions.
