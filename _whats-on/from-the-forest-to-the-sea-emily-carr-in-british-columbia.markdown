**"There's an openess to her paintings that reminds me of Vincent van Gogh"** - Peter Doig

The first UK exhibition dedicated to Emily Carr - one of Canada’s most beloved and esteemed artists, virtually unknown outside Canada. The exhibition will trace a dramatic trajectory from darkness to light. Visitors will first encounter Carr’s brooding, often claustrophobic forest scenes and the show will culminate in a display of Carr’s later euphoric sky paintings, rhythmic light-filled beach scenes and clear-cut landscapes.

Linking these two displays will be an intimate look at Carr’s explorations of the aboriginal coastal communities, bringing together a carefully selected sampling of her sketchbooks, writings, smaller watercolours and drawings, as well as related archival photography. In this transition from darkness to light, we will discover Carr the inquisitive documentarian, encountering a culture and a landscape that challenged her way of seeing and understanding the world.

The exhibition is curated by Canadian Art Critic and Journalist Sarah Milroy and Dulwich Picture Gallery Sackler Director Ian AC Dejardin. 

From the Forest to the Sea: Emily Carr in British Columbia has been organised by Dulwich Picture Gallery and the Art Gallery of Ontario with the generous collaboration of the National Gallery of Canada, Vancouver Art Gallery and the Royal BC Museum, BC Archives.
