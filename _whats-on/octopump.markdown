This autumn sees the return of Octopump, [The Royal Albert’s](http://www.royalalbertpub.com) fourth annual real ale and cider festival. Back and bigger than ever before, this three-day festival, spread across the 26th, 27th and 28th September, boasts over fifteen hand-selected local, and regional real ales and ciders.
 
To celebrate National Cask Ale Week and the UK’s hop-picking season, Octopump offers a superb selection of Kent based breweries. With the likes of Caveman, Kent Brewery, Canterbury Brewers, Ramsgate, The Canterbury Ales and Whitstable, plus many more found in the ale barn, you will be spoilt for choice and will be constantly kept on your toes throughout the weekend. Keep your eyes peeled for some rare green hop gems, brewed only once per year, and using the freshest of hops just hours after being harvested. But hurry, once the keg is empty, it’s gone for good!
 
If cider is more your tipple, Octopump will certainly not disappoint. With an impressive selection of traditional apple and pear ciders, sampling is simply a must.
 
Throughout the weekend The Royal Albert will be serving honest British pub fare, as well as some your best-loved traditional homemade snacks - including scotch eggs, sausage rolls and pork pies to accompany your beverage.
 
Providing the soundtrack to the Festival will be an assortment of some of New Cross’ finest local bands and DJs. Deptford veteran DJ Mario will be kicking off proceedings on Friday 26th with his eclectic box of 12” tricks. Saturday is very much a live music affair, featuring Blues, Rockabilly and Reggae four-piece band, John McClean and the Clan. Gather the kids and the family pooch for a lazy Sunday and sip the afternoon away listening to 50’s and 60’s soul and funk chart classics.
 
If all this wasn’t enough, pop your head into InSitu Project Space, The Royal Albert’s little sister pop-up gallery space, for a gander at the latest group exhibition by Creekside Collective, as part of this year’s Deptford X Festival.
 
With a strong emphasis on tasting, sharing and discovering, Octopump is an action-packed weekend both for the experienced ale drinker and the enthusiastic novice. With limited edition commemorative glasses which are new and exclusive to this year’s event.
Why not make your way to the bar and raise a toast to Octopump-mania?
