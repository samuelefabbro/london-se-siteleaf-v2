Considering the set square, compass and eye as starting points for surveying or constructing global infrastructure, South Kiosk will bring together new photographic works by Emma Charles alongside a selection of works from Alicja Dobrucka’s Life is on a New High series.

Charles’ project documents the Allegheny Mountain region in Pennsylvania, USA. In 2010, the Allegheny mountains were drilled through to make way for fibre-optic cables that link the major trading capitals of America. Carried out largely in secret, the $300 million project created small tunnels through the rock of the mountain in order to speed up high-frequency trading times by a matter of milliseconds.

Dobrucka’ s Life is on a New High aims to address the issue of the changing landscape of Mumbai, home to the largest number of supertalls and skyscrapers under construction in the world. Rising above greenery and tarpaulin, they tower over the slums that house the majority of Mumbaikers.

Both series consider a landscape that is being impacted in different capacities by economic growth and technological change.
