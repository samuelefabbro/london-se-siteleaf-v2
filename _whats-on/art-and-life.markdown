Art and Life: Ben Nicholson, Winifred Nicholson, Christopher Wood, Alfred Wallis, William Staite Murray, 1920 – 1931

Ben and Winifred Nicholson were at the forefront of the Modern British movement and produced some of the most memorable works of the period. This exhibition, curated by their grandson, Jovan Nicholson, will provide a rare opportunity to see their views of the same landscapes, seascapes, still lifes and portraits alongside pieces by contemporaries Christopher Wood, Alfred Wallis and the potter William Staite Murray.

Spanning over a decade of exciting artistic exchange, this is the first exhibition to consider the group of artists in the same context, over a period that shaped the careers of Ben and Winifred Nicholson irrevocably.

This exhibition continuing the Modern British series at Dulwich Picture Gallery is a collaboration between Dulwich Picture Gallery, Leeds Museums and Galleries (18 October 2013- 12 January 2014) and Kettle’s Yard, University of Cambridge (15 February-11 May 2014).
