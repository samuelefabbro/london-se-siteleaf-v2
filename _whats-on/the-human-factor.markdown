The Human Factor brings together major works by 25 leading international artists who have fashioned new ways of using the human body in contemporary sculpture.

The first show of its kind on this scale, The Human Factor focuses on sculpture that explores a variety of social, political, cultural and historical concerns spanning the past 25 years.

Ultimately, these artists treat the human body as a means for exploring the ways our society constructs identities, social positions and values.

Mirroring the viewer's own physical presence, these sculpted figures create encounters that can be at once playful, thought-provoking and unsettling.

Incorporating references as diverse as science fiction to war monuments, the exhibition comprises uncanny images of historical and political figures including Adolf Hitler, John F Kennedy, Dick Cheney and Jesus, as well as hauntingly familiar figures and enigmatic symbols of consumer culture.

Many of these works also pointedly revisit classical and archaic models of art as well as modernist sculpture and Minimalism.

The exhibition encompasses a wide array of recent practices – from hyper-realistic sculptures to near-abstract assemblages.

Contributing artists: Pawel Althamer, Frank Benson, Huma Bhabha, Maurizio Cattelan, Urs Fischer, Katharina Fritsch, Ryan Gander, Isa Genzken, Rachel Harrison, Georg Herold, Thomas Hirschhorn, Martin Honert, Pierre Huyghe, Jeff Koons, Paul McCarthy, John Miller, Cady Noland, Ugo Rondinone, Yinka Shonibare MBE, Thomas Schütte, Paloma Varga Weisz, Mark Wallinger, Rebecca Warren, Andro Wekua, and Cathy Wilkes.
