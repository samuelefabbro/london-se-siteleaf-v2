As in many museums, a large proportion of the Horniman Museum and Gardens' collections, are not on permanent display to the public.They are kept in secure storage, boxed and wrapped, in buildings sited away from the Museum itself.

Artist Mark Fairnington has spent the last fifteen years taking inspiration from visits to these unseen spaces, making paintings that reflect upon the things he has discovered.

Working with collections at the Natural History Museum, the Wellcome Collection and the Horniman Museum and Gardens, he has portrayed large-scale mounted insects the size of humans, birds of paradise specimens, panoramic views of specimens in stores and life-sized prize-winning bulls.

This exhibition is about the strange and the unexpected, it presents paintings made by the artist alongside some previously un-exhibited material from the Horniman’s collections.
