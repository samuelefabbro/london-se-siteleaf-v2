New and recent artworks by artist Polly Morgan will be on display in a new area at the entrance to the Horniman's historic Natural History Gallery.  

Polly’s work is at the forefront of the taxidermy renaissance. This temporary display, Taxidermy Is Dead (Long Live Taxidermy), illustrates how taxidermy is not a ‘dying art’, but an evolving art form.
