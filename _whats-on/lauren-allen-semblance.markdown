Debut solo exhibition of Lauren Allen, winner of the Vanguard Prize 2013.

Delving into the world of architecture, Lauren Allen's most recent body of work brings recognisable elements of buildings from existing environments into the gallery space. The artist intends to initiate a conversation between the viewer and the built environment through the work’s manipulation of size, material and interpretation.

Drawing from Modernistic/Brutalist industrial and residential buildings, Lauren Allen plays with the nature of materials such as concrete, fabric, cement and glass. The work compares the form and mass of architecture with personal interaction of space and ownership to form an abstraction of the quotidian. 
 
This exhibition marks the completion of Lauren Allen’s 12 month residency at Vanguard Court Studios.

Lauren Allen graduated from Camberwell College of Arts in 2013 with a BA in Painting and is currently living and working in London.
