It's time to return to the night time, to gather together all of our spiciest traders, link up with some brilliant music people in one unique space and celebrate the spirit of carnival in South London!

We have partnered with Corsica Studios at their new space, The Paperworks, to bring the hurgh! and the GRrrr... back to Friday nights. It's been a brilliant summer so far and we want to honour this heatwave by putting something completely new on: Carnival del KERB

What's it about? Good times, real flavours and harnessing the energy of SE1 through all things spicy. 

Free entry, bring cash - and you must know the drill by now - ELASTICATED WAISTBANDS - for the eating and the bogling ; )
