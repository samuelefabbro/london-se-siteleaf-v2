An old cash and carry in Peckham is being 
transformed into a Spiedini & Spritz bar...

For the past three years Forza Win could be found in many different places all over London. Now they’ve found an ‘al fresco’ spot in which they can cook and serve awesome communal suppers to their hearts content, year round. It won’t stop them going exploring, but for summer 2014, they’re firmly grounded. 

‘The Dispensa’ will open 3 days per week and for brunches at weekends. 
For £25, seventy evening guests will sit down together to feast on fresh pastas, a  main course of woodfired spiedini made with Ginger Pig meats, salads and a  dessert. There will be a ‘top up’ option on every course. Drinks wise, there’s a vending machine full of beer, an Italianate cocktail bar and natural wine list. 

The team will be working with all British produce to create an awesome and  authentic Italian meal.
