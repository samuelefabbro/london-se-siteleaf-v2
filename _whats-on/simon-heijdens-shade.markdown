The first NOW Commission has been awarded to Simon Heijdens. He will continue his ongoing practice of tracing and revealing the essence and narrative of static spaces, and will present an immersive installation and site-specific commission from 19 September to 19 December 2014.
Simon Heijdens’ installation shades NOW Gallery with an intelligent skin applied to the 7 metre glass, it forms a kaleidoscope of light and shadow choreographed by the elements, translating the unplanned natural timeline of the outdoor to the indoor space.
A master of understated interventions, Simon Heijdens has produced beautiful works that have been installed in museums and galleries all over the world. He was chosen from a shortlist of Ab Rogers, Atelier NL, and Studio Roso.
