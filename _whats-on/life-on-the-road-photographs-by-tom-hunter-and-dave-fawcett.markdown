This exhibition, showing work by photographers Tom Hunter and Dave Fawcett, and filmmaker Andrew Gaston captures a remarkable moment in time, in the 1990s, when young people travelled around Europe in a variety of vehicles adapted as homes, forming transitory communities based around festivals, music and a shared rejection of the increasingly consumerist values of Western society.

Travelling in decommissioned buses and vans, these new explorers constructed a vision of a kind of utopia, which is now embedded in our collective memory of the 1990s. From Hunter’s documentary of everyday life on the road, to Fawcett’s meticulous record of traveller buses, and Gaston’s elegiac footage of parties, this exhibition, which is an integral part of UAL Green Week, is both celebration and memorial.

Life on the Road is a Photography and the Archive Research Centre (PARC) project, made in partnership with UAL and LCC as part of Green Week, 2014.
