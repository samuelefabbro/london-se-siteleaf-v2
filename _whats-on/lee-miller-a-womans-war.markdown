Explore the impact of the Second World War on women's lives through the photography of Lee Miller, one of the most important war photographers of the twentieth century. 

This exhibition documents Miller’s evolving vision of women’s roles and lives in Britain and Europe as she travelled between countries before, during and in the immediate aftermath of war.

Over 150 images are on display alongside Picasso’s portrait of Miller, personal correspondence with Vogue founder Conde Nast and many other objects never seen before.
