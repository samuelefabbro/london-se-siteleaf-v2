Photographer Eileen Perrier will make new work from a mobile studio in Peckham this summer as part of the latest commission from independent gallery and charity Peckham Platform.

The exhibition, opening September, will feature black and white portraits of local people taken by Perrier on Peckham Square. Paying homage to Victorian styles and techniques, passers by will be photographed in a mobile studio using a large format camera and headrest. The resulting formal portraits will be mounted both inside and outside the gallery.

Year 10 pupils at Harris Academy Peckham are currently participating in photography workshops with Perrier. Drawing on Perrier’s past projects, students have been taking images in classroom sessions, using family photographs and personal photo albums as a discussion point.

To accompany the exhibition, Autograph ABP – the organisation that campaigns for the inclusion of historically marginalised photographic practices – will produce a limited edition newspaper documenting the project and the work by pupils at Harris Academy, for publication during Frieze Art Fair (October).

Learning Activities 
Throughout the exhibition we offer free drop in activities for people of all ages to learn about photography. Join us to learn about the links between photography, drawing and portraiture with use of a camera obscura. We are now a fully registered ‘Arts Award Centre’, meaning we are qualified to cater for school groups. So should you want to book a school group for a visit to the exhibition, please contact our Learning Officer Peter Rhodes on peter@peckhamplatform.com.
