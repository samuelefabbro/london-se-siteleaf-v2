Speakers Corner
Hyde Park Corner, London, England. Every Sunday since at least 1872.

Sometime around 2009 I became a part of the ongoing street theatre that is Speakers Corner. Graduating from detached photographic Voyeur to fully-fledged participant, heckler occasional bit player.

I have joined a cast of thousands that have come to this place to express their views, however controversial or off the wall, over the last hundred or so years. Religion is the current hot topic, especially Islam, but over the years the area has attracted notable political and human rights activists including Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin and William Morris and still hosts a very lively Marxist forum and a selection of anarchist, conservative and socialist speakers.
This work, as it stands, is not intended to answer any big questions or reveal any deep insight into the reasons people attend this place.

I am not sure I am even qualified to ask those sorts of questions. I hoped only in some small way to take you on a little sensory wander around the place.

John Gladdy is a London based photographer and filmmaker working in the field of music. All his main work and long term photojournalism projects, such as Dogmata, of which Speakers Corner is part, is made with traditional photographic materials. Spearkers Corner was shot in it’s entirety on Ilford HP5+ film, and printed on both Ilford Multigrade FB paper and Ilford Gallerie Inkjet paper.
