Hello my Little Tea Cups, Little Nan here!

I was so so Sad when we had to suddenly leave my home in Deptford & Brockley last month due to a matter out of my control concerning the venue’s we were operating in, that with tears in my eyes I packed my bags and headed off to the family timeshare villa in the Costa De Blanca with the Grandkids and my favorite teapot (it was the Lady Cat one if you are wondering) 

When I was out on the beach I received a phone call from my Turkish Grand Daughters (from my Turkish side of the family) who own the adorable Birdie Num Nums Café, and they kindly offered me a Weekend night shelter within their café in New Cross so I can continue to spoil you all with my vintage Teapots and fine bone china Teacups full of Cocktails & boozy delights until I find my new permanent home. 

I am ever so delighted to invite you around every Friday & Saturday from the 15th August – 27th September 6pm – Midnight for all your old time favorites including Lady Bet Lynch, Lord Roy Walker, Lady Council Princess, Peckham Prince & Duke of Deptford, along with sampling a Teapot of my new soon to be Fav’s – ‘The Queen of New Cross’, ‘Prince of Hatcham’ & ‘ Empress Big Mo Slater’ 

My Grandchildren will also be spoiling you with a fridge full of Italy’s finest Prosecco, Craft and popular lagers, wines, bottles of Bubbles and my Candy Vodka shots, whilst the Birdie Sisters will be cooking up Turkish/ British inspired canapés served on my 3tier cake stands to keep your bellies full and happy. No grumpy bellies round your Nan’s please! 

Popping in is totally okay (and there is outside seating along with till Midnight opening hours!!) but do let my Grandson Tristan know if you would like to reserve a table, and if it’s your Birthday or celebration I will name a bespoke cocktail in your honor. 

I have been so lonely over the last month and thanks to 2 lovely sisters who have helped an old lady out and shown how working together & local support means more than love itself I am able to spoil you all once again. 

Lots of Love, Little Nan and my Grandchildren xx
