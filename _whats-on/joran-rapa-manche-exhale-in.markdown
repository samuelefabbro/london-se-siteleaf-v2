Joran Rapa Manché presents Exhale-in, his solo exhibition in 
the Caroline Garden Chapel in Peckham. Supported below the 
chapel’s ceiling, eight white corrugated sculptures alternately expand and contract like bellows. Hovering two metres above the ground at their full extension, viewers can walk underneath the constantly moving pillars. 

The eight octagonal cardboard columns, sheathed in a latex skin, contract under the direction of the domestic vacuum cleaners, until they are fifty centimetres in length. Once the motor has cut out, the columns slowly expand downwards to a length of six metres, revealing their concertina structure beneath the latex. The continual expansion and contraction of the eight columns repeats itself in a loop, one rising under the suction of the vacuum cleaner while others fall under the force of gravity. 

The asylum chapel in Southwark, dates from 1830s and is part of the largest set of almshouses in London. The chapel is now used as project and exhibition space whose height and scale enhances the drama of the Exhale-in exhibition.
