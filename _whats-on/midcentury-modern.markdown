**"The best pop up museum style shop" – London Design Guide**

Love Scandinavian and American Modernism, European Bauhaus, British, French and German Industrial? Looking for a huge range of prices and styles from the best in 20C design classics and modern collectables? Find it here at the celebrated show backed by Elle Decoration that has been lauded as a top shopping experience by Time Out, Monocle, Rough Guide to Vintage London, Grand Designs and the London Design Guide. 

Find everything for the eclectic home at this much-loved one day show from an original Cherner chair to a contemporary piece from a hot young British designer. Source the latest furniture, wallpaper, ceramics, cushions and gifts upstairs after you have scoured the most collectable vintage furniture and home ephemera on the planet downstairs.

Midcentury Modern and The Midcentury Show have a cult following of midcentury aficianados and design lovers from all over the British Isles who gather one Sunday a few times a year at Lords Cricket Ground and Dulwich College to feed off their mutual love for design at what has been described as an inspiring museum-style pop up shop
