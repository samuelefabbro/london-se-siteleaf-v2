Dorine van Meel is the fourth recipient of the Nina Stewart Artist Residency at the SLG. For her first solo show in a public gallery Van Meel presents a multi-channel installation exploring language and female subjectivity, through a soundtrack of two female narrators combined with alternating projections of digital imagery.

Van Meel’s practice is situated within and between the media of moving image, sculpture and installation. Expanding the moving image beyond its frame, she sets up relationships between the work, exhibition space and viewer – both of an experiential and affective kind. Drawing on stories, histories, personal experiences and observations of day-to-day reality, fragmented narratives and forms of subjectivity are constructed through an interplay of voices and signs.

To accompany her exhibition Between the Dog and the Wolf, Van Meel is producing a publication which brings together a group of peer contributors to explore the ways in which specific use of language and words can create a sense of space, time, class and cultural identity. Van Meel's publication will be launched at the SLG on 27 May, which will include a performative reading by its collaborative authors, during which the book will be available to purchase in the SLG bookshop.
