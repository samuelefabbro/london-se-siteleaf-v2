This exhibition explores how battlefields are spaces of memory and remembrance, and can become sites of pilgrimage for those who wish to remember the loss of their loved ones. Works from three photographers who have engaged with the ‘hollows of memory’ that the landscape contains is represented. These are the World War One postcards of before and after the destruction of the Belgian town of Ypres made by the Antony Brothers, the British First World War Cemeteries documented by Daniel Alexander, and the D-day landing beaches photographed by Simon Norfolk. The works are curated by Paul Lowe.

This is a Photography and the Archive Research Centre event in association with the LCC Graduate School.
