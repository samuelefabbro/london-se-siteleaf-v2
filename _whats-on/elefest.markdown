**Elefest is Elephant and Castle’s Festival.** It is a celebration of the best known but misunderstood parts of London. Elefest is now in its 11th year, and the area is once again on the verge of massive change. Elefest programme celebrates the past, present and future of the Elephant and Castle. It mixes home grown with national and international talent and some that are in between…

For the 2013 edition, Elefest brought top class entertainment to the Elephant & Castle and surrounding areas with three major pop-up cinema and music events, a leading night market, skate festival, and several activities that look at the local landscape, from a Treasure Hunt to a guerrilla gardening dig a tour of the subway murals and a slide show about the history of the area and how it was once known as the “Piccadilly of the South”.

In previous years we have run outdoor cinemas, set up a solar powered cinema on the Heygate Estate, photographic exhibition in the subways of Elephant and Castle and hosted a showcase from Paloma Faith at Corsica Studios before she hit the spotlight.

Our logo “Nellie” is taken from the tiled design on the ground floor of the iconic Elephant and Castle Shopping Centre built in 1965 by architects Boissevain & Osmond and due for demolition before the end of the decade. It was the first enclosed shopping mall and office complex in the UK and will turn 50 next year.
