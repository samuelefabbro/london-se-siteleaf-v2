**Can you tell the difference between an Old Master painting and a contemporary replica?**

Working with conceptual artist Doug Fishbone we are encouraging you to take a closer look at our Permanent Collection. One of our works has been replaced by a replica painting sourced from an artists’ workshop in China and hung in the frame belonging to the original. For three months the identity of the work will remain concealed. Test your discerning eye and tell us which painting you think it is.

Many Old Master painters, from Titian to Rubens, encouraged the copying of their work either in their workshops by apprentices or by independent copyists. There are several examples in Dulwich’s collection including workshop paintings such as Venus and Adonis and copies painted from the original by artists visiting the Gallery such as Constable’s copy of Ruisdael’s Windmills. Today, famous paintings are being reproduced in the millions with China dominating this export market.

For three months (10 February – 26 April) you are invited to find the replicated painting, which hangs in place of the original in the permanent display of 270 works. Winning answers will be entered into a draw to win one of five print-on-demand reproductions of chosen works in the Gallery’s collection. The answer will be revealed on 28 April when original and replica will hang side by side. Come and compare the two.

Co-curated by conceptual artist Doug Fishbone and Dr Xavier Bray, Arturo and Holly Melosi Chief Curator at the Gallery.
