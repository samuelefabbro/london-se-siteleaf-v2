18th September 17:30 - 23:00

Join us for an evening celebration of some of the organisations supported by Urban Food Routes - a unique initiative funded by the Mayor of London and Seeds of Change helping a variety of London's small food enterprises that are working with their local communities.

The event sits within Urban Food Fortnight, an annual series of events celebrating ultra-local produce being grown, produced and cooked across London.

Expect great food, innovative organisations and a very special bar making this a highlight of Urban Food Fortnight.
