LCC celebrates ten years of London-based graphic art label and online boutique Stereohype, sister company of design studio FL@33, and their popular button badge collection. This tenth anniversary exhibition also marks the fact that the collection, created by over 300 contributors, will reach its 1,000th button badge this September, with each badge being showcased including an anniversary poster and badge project specially commissioned for the occasion.
