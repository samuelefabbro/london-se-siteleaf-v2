South Kiosk will be turning its gallery into a screening space, for a series of one-off events taking place over the course of latter summer months. 
 
Tuesday July 22nd – David Blair ‘Wax or the Discovery of Television Among the Bees
 
For their first event, South Kiosk are excited to be showing Wax or the Discovery of Television Among the Bees (1992) by David Blair. Wax or the Discovery of Television Among the Bees is an independent feature film (featuring a cameo by William Burroughs), that takes the viewer through a world of supernormal photography, flight simulation, Mesopotamian bees and telepathic communication. Transferred to a digital format from a VCR format, Wax was the first film to have been streamed on the Internet, and was also the first to have been re-formatted as hypertext and posted online.

Tuesday August 5th - Oscillate Wildly: Video Feedback and Analogue Visuals 
Featuring work by James Alec Hardy, Phil Baljeu, Will Cenci, Greg Zifcak, Dan Sandin

For Oscillating Wildly, South Kiosk will work with a number of artists, musicians and technologists to construct an immersive installation of flickering CRT surfaces. The various works will offer up a series of experiments in visual mutation through analogue processes, and the degradation of video signal and the VHS tape format. These different approaches offer perspective on a particular branch of filmmaking, and sonic experimentation.

August 19th - Centralia: An Evening of Artist Video and Film Screenings
Featuring work by Emily Richardson, Cressida Kocienski and more tbc
 
Cobra Mist
Cobra Mist by Emily Richardson is a 16mm film exploring the relationship between the landscape of Orford Ness and the traces of its military history, particularly the experiments in radar and the extraordinary architecture of the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment. Much of what took place there is still under the official secrets act so will only be revealed over time. The buildings have been left to the elements to deteriorate, creating a tension between the time it will take for their secrets to come out and for the buildings to disappear. The soundtrack is composed by Benedict Drew from sound recordings taken from Orford Ness by Chris Watson.

Unorganized North Algoma
Organised around the 'event' of forest fires in the landscape — but visualising fire only as trace, Cressida Kocienski's Unorganized North Algoma traces the complexities of the production of landscape by human agents, commercial interests, and civic infrastructures. The work juxtaposes audio-only interviews with local residents, largely those affiliated with fire management and logging industries, with images of burned sites, aerial boreal forest views, fire training, and an inactive mill in a remote company town. This film provides subtle insights into issues affecting communities with sparse and waning populations, and experiments with modes of narration and the spatial production of the Canadian landscape.

September 5th - Daniel Jones ‘Reordering 1 (Sans Soleil)’

South Kiosk is excited to be screening Daniel Jones' Ordering #1 (Sans/Soleil), a reworking of Chris Marker’s Sans Soleil (1983) in which the film’s frames are sorted in order of luminosity. A prolonged viewing dispels the suggestion that the re-ordering is chaotic. Patterns and structures being to emerge, as the film moves from the darkest frames of its opening to those of maximal brightness.

September 6th - Thompson & Craighead ‘The Time Machine In Alphabetical Order’

The Time Machine In Alphabetical Order is a complete rendition of the 1960's film version of the HG Wells Novella, re-edited by Thompson & Craighead into alphabetical order from beginning to end. In doing so, the artists attempt to perform a kind of time travel on the movie's original time-line through the use of a system of classification.
