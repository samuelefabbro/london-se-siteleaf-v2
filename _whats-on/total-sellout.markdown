Total Sellout is an unconventional art sale that has taken place in Berlin and Dresden for the last twelve years. In October we will be bringing the show to London for the very first time.

The mandate of Total Sellout is to give people the opportunity to own artworks by established artists for an unusually affordable price. For one weekend only, artists will exhibit and sell all manner of works including prints, sculpture and even one-off originals which will all be available to buy.

The line-up of artists comprises of some of the most exciting contemporary illustrators working today, including many London and Brighton graduates, as well as international artists.

The Private View will be held at Daily Goods coffee shop (36 Camberwell Church Street, London SE5 0NS) on Friday the 10 October, from 4 – 9pm. The artists and artwork will be in the vicinity until the show closes on Sunday evening. Some contributors will be in residence for the whole weekend so come down and say hello.
