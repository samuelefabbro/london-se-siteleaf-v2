This annual exhibition, which celebrates new and emerging design talent, will open 10 September 2014 and feature the designers selected by a distinguished panel.

This year’s theme is disruption and Deyan Sudjic, Director of the Design Museum, explains:
‘More than most, ‘disruptive’ is a term whose meaning is dependent on the context. Conventionally considered almost invariably a bad thing – difficult pupils, bad neighbours, ill-considered town planning - it is now the most sought after quality in a new product. It has completely overtaken the previously well regarded term sustainable, and its slightly more current synonym, resilient. Disruptive technologies are what made Apple’s comeback a decade ago so successful. Disruptive innovation interrupts established ways of thinking, diverges from traditional practices and proposes new, unexpected ideas.

The 2014 residents are: 
James Christian 
Ilona Gaynor 
Torsten Sherwood 
Patrick Stevenson-Keating

Come to a disruptive event at the museum.
