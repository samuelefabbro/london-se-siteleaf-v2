Made in Tuscany last summer, each individual work is the result of a prolonged period of reflection and action - energetic marks culminating in a crescendo of colour. These paintings exhibit a process that is free and intuitive in its laying down of marks and complex and calculated in its building up of layers.

Shaun McDowell has advanced the artistic language of the paintings in his exhibition The Souvenir (2012) by using transparent layers and subtle colour juxtapositions to manipulate relative chromatic density and generate a sense of space through colour.

He would like to thank Villa Lena for supporting the making of these paintings.
