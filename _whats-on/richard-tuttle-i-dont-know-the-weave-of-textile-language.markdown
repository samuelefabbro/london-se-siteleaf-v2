Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall has played host to some of the world’s most striking and memorable works of contemporary art. Now, this vast space welcomes the largest work ever created by renowned American sculptor Richard Tuttle (born 1941).

Entitled I Don’t Know . The Weave of Textile Language, this newly commissioned sculpture combines vast sways of fabrics designed by the artist from both man-made and natural fibres in three bold and brilliant colours.

The commission is part of a wider survey of the artist taking place in London this autumn and comprising a major exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery surveying five decades of Tuttle’s career and a sumptuous new publication rooted in the artist’s own collection of historic and contemporary textiles.
