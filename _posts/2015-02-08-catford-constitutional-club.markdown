Hidden from view, down an alleyway on Catford Brodway, is The Catford Constitutional Club. Another successful venture from the team behind [Sylvan Post](/spots/sylvan-post) and [Royal Albert](/spots/royal-albert), Antic seem to have hit the jackpot with this gem of a building.

They’ve got the menu just right and it’s not an exaggeration to say that their rib eye steak, which comes topped with tarragon and peppercorn butter, is the best that we've tasted in South East London. It's always exciting to find a chef that understands that 'rare' means 'bloody'! Alongside the interesting and reasonably priced menu, there's the usual great range of ales, ciders and wines that you’d come to expect from the [Antic group](http://anticlondon.com/).

The building formally known as the Catford Conservative Club, sat vacant for over a decade. Antic took it on after having to shut the Catford Bridge Tavern due to tenancy issues. Luckily the closure of one pub has meant the opening of another. Antic have done a fantastic job of preserving the features of Catford’s oldest building (built in 1736). The parquet flooring, candle-lit dining room and even the grandiose ladies’ loos are all reasons to visit. The character, menu and friendly staff make this one of the best things to have happened to Catford in quite some time.
