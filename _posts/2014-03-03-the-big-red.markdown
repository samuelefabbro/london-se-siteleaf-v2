You might be forgiven for thinking that there isn't a lot going on around Deptford Church Street. However, you'd be wrong. Take a walk around the corner from Deptford High Street, and find the bright burst of colour that is the Big Red Pizza Bus, attached to the side of The Bird's Nest pub. 

Owner and local sculpture, John Cierach, acquired the "unloved bus and land" in 2011, and in his words, "decided to do something positive and creative, so that people could have some fun."

Climb aboard the big red route master, or sit in the under-cover patio and choose from the delicious pizzas, pastas and salads. All ingredients are from Borough Market.  

A fantastic space that has a self-contained cinema (in the form of a van), and also plays host to local bands. Look out for the local delivery service coming soon...
