Husband and wife team, Fergus and Sharmin Jackson, are passionate about bread. The bread sold at their all-in-one bakery, shop and cafe—just off Lordship Lane—is proof of the fact. 

After a [road to Damascus moment](http://peckhampeculiar.tumblr.com/post/95188927444/mothers-pride-by-fergus-jackson) at St. John restaurant, Fergus became a disciple of sourdough. He quit his job in advertising, and he and Sharmin traveled to San Francisco in 2011, where he trained at the San Francisco Baking Institute. 

The couple have been supplying high profile retailers and restaurants including Neal's Yard Dairy, Duck Soup and The Camberwell Arms since starting their business in 2012, and have now opened their first shop and cafe to the public, from an old electrical warehouse just off Lordship Lane.

The warehouse itself feels light and spacious, with white walls and an open kitchen where you can watch the bakers at work. Alongside the award winning sourdough are pastries, as well as a weekly changing breakfast and lunch menu comprising of simple, seasonal food, not to mention an impressive cup of coffee.

The current holder of the Real Bread Campaign’s London Loaf, is Brick House’s Peckham Rye. However, if you’re visiting during breakfast hours, we’d recommend trying the morning bun, which is dusted in citrus sugar – amazing!
