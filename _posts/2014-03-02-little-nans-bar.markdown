Hidden away from the hustle and bustle of Deptford Broadway (and down an unmarked, dodgy-looking hallway) is the aptly named Little Nan's. 

Its creator, Tristan, an employee of the Bunker Club, asked whether he could set up a bar in what was being used as a storage area of the club. Since then, Little Nan's 'Living Room' has become a permanent fixture.

Step inside your Nanna's front room and take a seat on an armchair or sofa, under the watchful gaze of Paddy Ashdown, while Tristan prepares one of the Royal Family themed cocktails in a mug (£4) or teapot (£12). There are also decently priced beers on draft, and a wine list.

A really friendly bar,which has has managed to attract a mixed crowd of customers. Try the 'Queen Victoria' cocktail with a tea cup full of cheese straws on the side.
