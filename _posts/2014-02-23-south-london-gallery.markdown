First opened as The 'South London Fine Arts Gallery' in 1891, the gallery today plays host to a wide range of international contemporary artists. Past exhibitions have included works from artists such as Tom Friedman, Eva Rothschild, Tracey Emin and Anish Kapoor amongst others.

The gallery itself is split over two floors. The ground floor houses the main exhibition hall where larger scale works are shown. Tracey Emin's tent, Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995 was shown here. Two smaller exhibition rooms are found in the Victorian terrace next door.

The gallery has recently purchased the neighbouring terraced house in order to build the cafe, [No.67](http://number67.co.uk/), as well as the Clore Studio, in which education and art outreach workshops take place.

With its free admission, as well as its local outreach programs, The South London Gallery is a valued asset to the local area. The cafe, although expensive, serves a great coffee and a mean bourbon-syrup waffle.
