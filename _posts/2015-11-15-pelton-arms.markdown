Hidden from the swathes of tourists in Greenwich, The Pelton Arms is tucked away on a quiet street, and just a short walk from the river. This attractive Victorian corner pub is the perfect retreat from the crowds and is renowned for its friendly atmosphere and a loyal set of locals.

Step inside from the hanging baskets and brick fronted exterior, and visitors are met with a cosy and traditional space with leather sofas, real fires, and a dart board and billiards. The Pelton Arms boasts an impressive social calendar, with a weekly knitting club, vinyl night and quiz. The main attraction here, however, is the pub’s line up of local bands that take to the stage most weekends. It’s definitely worth checking the pub’s website for [upcoming shows](http://www.peltonarms.com/?page_id=88).

As one would expect in this kind of traditional pub, there is a good selection of rotating ales here — Woolwich-brewed [Hop Stuff](http://www.hopstuffbrewery.com/) was on the pump during our last visit. There are also the regulars, like Greenwich’s own [Meantime](http://www.meantimebrewing.com/).

Alongside the real ales and ciders on the pumps, the food here doesn’t disappoint. Pub favourites such as; fish and chips, pie, mash and liquor, and burgers are all reasonably priced. they also serve a popular Sunday Roast with all the trimmings for under £10. This local has all the essentials of a great London pub, and is within walking distance of some of Greenwich’s most famous sights.
