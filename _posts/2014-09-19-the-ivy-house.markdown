A true local, The Ivy House is London's first co-operatively owned pub. Back in 2012, at the face of developer plans to convert the pub into flats, a group of locals were able to raise funds to buy the freehold. With the freehold in place, [a community share scheme was opened](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-22016830) to fund the reopening of the 1930's building as a pub.

Now run by those 371 shareholders, The Ivy House is a lovingly restored pub that has maintained its unique Art Deco ballroom and stage. In its previous life, the pub saw the likes of Ian Dury and Joe Strummer tread the boards. Today, the Ivy House plays host to a number of events and regularly has live music.

As well as its role of community events hub, it also serves an extensive range of locally brewed beers and ales. It offers a great selection of constantly changing beers from the likes of [Brockley Brewery](http://brockleybrewery.co.uk/), [Bear Hug](http://www.bearhugbrewing.com/) of Peckham and Bermondsey-based [The Kernel](http://www.thekernelbrewery.com/) – amongst many others further afield. Add to this, a slightly American take on pub grub featuring burgers, chilli dogs and nachos, and it's clear that the community takeover has been a success.
