Tucked away on a quiet residential street, a short walk from the Rye, is a friendly neighbourhood pub with pizzas, dogs and music. On entering, the bar looks like a traditional South London pub, with its dark wood panelled walls and well-worn, yet comfy furniture.

The Gowlett ‘belongs’ to the locals of the area, and is always a friendly place to pop in for a pizza and pint. On Thursdays, locals bring their own vinyl to 'Lucky 7's' night, where each person awaits their 15 minutes of DJ fame. 

Perhaps the biggest selling point of this pub however, is its pizza menu. Choose from the selection of thin-based, and topping-heavy pizzas, such as the 'Gowlettini', with goats cheese, prosciutto, pine nuts and rocket, and the Hawaiian – described on the menu as being "made in Peckham by Poles”, it has nothing much to do with Hawaii, really.

Come for the pizza, rotating selection of  ales, and to say hello to the landlord's dog, Dallas.
