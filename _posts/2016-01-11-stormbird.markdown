Living close to Camberwell Church Street—as we did for two years—is a blessing. This busy stretch manages to pack in a varied selection of restaurants and drinking holes ([Silk Road](/spots/silk-road-camberwell/), Camberwell Arms, Theo’s to name just a few). It delivers on exciting new ventures, as well as tried and tested favourites that demand to be revisited. One such beloved favourite is Stormbird.

The space is simply decorated. A wood panelled bar, scuffed floorboards and mismatched chairs allow the vast range of beers to take the limelight (there isn’t a food menu but staff are happy for customers to order food from some of the surrounding restaurants). 

You can choose to have beers served by the third-pint which means that you can spend an evening sampling the array from all over the world (Mikkeller, Brooklyn Brewery), as well as those that are brewed closer to home (Beavertown, Kernel, Brew by numbers). If beer isn’t your thing, it’s worth paying a visit to sample the craft spirits and the laid back atmosphere. The staff and locals are friendly, and the music played low enough for conversation; the perfect after work drinking spot.
