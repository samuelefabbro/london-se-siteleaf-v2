Arlo and Moe sells a wider than your average selection of brunch options (go for one of the ingeniously named 'sexy toasts’), as well as a great selection of cakes and sweet treats. Don't leave without trying the chocolate Guinness cake!

The brother and sister-in law team behind ’Arlo and Moe’ have retained the beautiful signage of this former barber-shop and it now sits pride of place in their ’Americana-Kitsch’ coffee shop.

Mr Lawrence and the Rivoli Ballroom are established favourites on this stretch of Crofton Park, and Arlo and Moe has been a successful addition.
