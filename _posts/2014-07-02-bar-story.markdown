Set beneath a rumbling Peckham Rye Station railway arch, Bar Story is a gem set off the grubby and bustling Rye Lane. The interior is filled with long rows of communal tables and mis-matched chairs. A fire pit with railway sleeper seating can be found out the front. 

On offer, is an extensive (and cheap!) cocktail menu as well as decently priced food. Try the happy hour from 6-7pm everyday and get 2 cocktails for £7. On the menu, are samplings such as burgers from local butcher Flock and Herd, and plenty of offers including 2 pizzas for £10 on Tuesday nights.

In keeping with Peckham's proximity to Camberwell College of Art, many of the bars in the area are full with a younger crowd; Bar Story is no exception. It's a favourite with the students who gather around the fire pits out the front during the winter, and overflow into the car park out the back during the warmer months.

Bar Story is a long-standing institution in Peckham, having being open since 2003. Bar Story, along with other businesses in the area surrounding Peckham Rye station, are under threat due to [redevelopment by Network Rail](http://www.spectacle.co.uk/spectacleblog/peckham/the-peckham-rye-lane-station-gateway-redevelopment-project-by-network-rail/).
