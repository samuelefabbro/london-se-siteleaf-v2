This pub, which is tucked away from the bustle of the Queens Road in Peckham, was a great find and reminded me of why I love living in South-East London. Traditional features, including a gorgeous Victorian polished wood bar, open (working!) fire places and plenty of great tile… What more could one want from a local?

An eclectic mix of clientele (including regular 'part of the furniture' Bill who asked us to vacate 'his' seat) Friendly landlords and the most eccentric 'quizzy quiz', run by quiz master Phil Nice.

The menu has several vegetarian options alongside the traditional pub favourites, and fish is supplied by the renowned local fishmonger 'FC Soper and Sons" in Nunhead.
