Back for another summer after last year’s success, the team behind Dalston’s [Street Feast](http://www.streetfeastlondon.com/) have once more brought the winning formula to this disused 1950’s indoor/outdoor market.

The Model Market at Lewisham Shopping Centre was closed down a few years ago and had been earmarked for demolition. Luckily, the council refused permission and the Street Feast team seized the opportunity to open a new location south of the river. They have been able to preserve some of the original details and signage from the old hair salons and record shops that were once found in the market.

Doors open at 5pm on Friday and Saturday. Make sure to arrive early, as crowds gather quickly to sample the fantastic food on offer here. Vendors include SE London favourites: [Mother Flipper](http://motherflipperburgers.com/), [SE Cakery](http://www.southeastcakery.com/) and [Mama’s Jerk](http://www.mamasjerkstation.com/) as well as Indian street food, [Rola Wala](http://www.rolawala.com/) and soft steamed buns from [Yum Bun](http://www.yumbun.com/). 

If you’re finding it difficult to make a decision, our personal recommendation would be the brisket or ribs from [Smokestak](http://www.smokestak.co.uk/), followed by a honeycomb brownie from SE Cakery.

This year’s addition of the Sky-line roof terrace bar, as well as frozen margarita’s (think tequila slush puppies!) make Lewisham a surprising top weekend destination this summer.
