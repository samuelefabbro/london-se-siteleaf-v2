A popular addition to this busy stretch in New Cross, which already boasts [The London Particular](http://www.thelondonparticular.co.uk/) and [The LP Bar](http://www.thelpbar.co.uk/), Maddy's Fish Bar is a step above your average Chippy. All food on the menu is fresh, locally sourced and seasonal, and there are twists on the usual fish and chip shop offerings. Specials such as 'beetroot cured salmon', as well as the genius touch of dill-infused batter on the seasonal fish options, are examples of details which make Maddy's stand apart.

Be sure to try the fish finger sandwich, made with a homemade sweet and tangy tartare sauce, as well as Japanese-inspired sides such as lightly textured tempura veg. Also, don't miss the pickled egg that comes with a soft oozing yolk, floating in a small dish of pickling broth.

The drinks menu includes a selection of 'Crate' beer and cider on tap, as well as wines that have been chosen to complement the food.

This fish bar is a perfect addition to New Cross. Though a little pricier than your average fish and chip shop, the cost relates to the freshness and quality of the food.
