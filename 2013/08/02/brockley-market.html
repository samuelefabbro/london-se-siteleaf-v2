<p>Open on Saturdays from 10-2pm, this market is held in a nondescript Car Park at Lewisham College. It has become somewhat of a hot spot for top quality street-food vendors, as well as butchers, farmers and bakers.</p>

<p>The market has attracted big names such as <a href="http://motherflipperburgers.com/">Mother-Flipper</a> and <a href="http://www.fleischmob.co.uk/">Fleishmob</a>, and <a href="http://www.darkfluid.co.uk/">Dark Fluid coffee</a>. This is not really a place to do the weekly shop (Lewisham market a little further down the road is a great place to pick up your weekly fruit and veg). Rather, itâ€™s more of a place to gorge on weekend goodies and treat yourself to a burger for breakfast.</p>

<p>However, there are a few stalls selling fruit and veg from Kentish farms, as well as independent butchers, fish mongers and delicatessens. The produce is of fantastic quality and is well worth a look.</p>
