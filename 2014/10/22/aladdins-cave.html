<p>The streets of Brockley are a great place to pick up items of second furniture that have been left on the roadside. As a matter of fact, London SE furnished their first flat this way. However, should you ever need it, this reclamation yard is hard to miss. Head past Brockley Market, towards Lewisham, and you’ll be met by the odd sight of eerie mannequins, <a href="http://www.kuriositas.com/2011/05/predator-in-london.html">the Predator</a>, as well as a life-sized statue of James Dean standing on top of a disused railway station, emblazoned with <em>Aladdin’s Cave</em> on the wall out front.</p>

<p>There are an overwhelming amount of items on display here; from old school tables and chairs to more niche goods such as Victorian fireplaces and tiles. Inside, more delicate items such as mirrors and fine china can be found.</p>

<p>The space is deceptively large, and the back seems to be full with porcelain toilets and sinks for as far as the eye can see. Don’t forget to browse the impressive collection of chairs that are dangling ominously overhead.</p>

<p>Aladdin’s Cave is a great place to stroll around and discover a bargain. The staff are usually happy to negotiate on prices and can provide a delivery service. Whether you’re looking for salvage items to redecorate your house, or just to browse the eclectic pieces on offer, Aladdin’s Cave is great for both; you never quite know what you’ll come away with.</p>
