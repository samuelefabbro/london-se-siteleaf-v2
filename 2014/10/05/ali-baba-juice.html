<p>Ali Baba Juice opened in February 2014 and has been growing popular with Peckham locals ever since. Tucked away down the alley opposite Rye station, partners Chris and Sienna have been harnessing the weird and wonderful fruits of Rye Lane to create juices packed full of flavour.</p>

<p>Before starting Ali Baba Juice, Chris and Sienna were working in TV and Film while on the hunt for something fun and interesting to do on the weekends. A juice bar was born after getting to know local Rye Lane grocers and namesake Ali Baba. The duo still source most of their ingredients from them.</p>

<p>Their summer menu included interesting combos such as <em>Watermelon, Aloe and Red Pepper</em>. Their new specials reflect the change of season, with autumnal flavours like <em>beetroot, apple and wasabi</em> and <em>spiced pumpkin, carrot and maple</em>. Alongside their seasonal specials, there are the classics which include <em>Apple, Puna yam, Banana and Lime</em> (a personal favourite). If juice isn’t what you’re in the mood for, you can also pick up a coffee, or matcha (a type of fine powder green tea).</p>

<p>Ali Baba has been a great addition to Rye Lane. Chris and Sienna, as well as their team, are friendly and welcoming. This means that going to buy a juice becomes a social affair. You’re likely to find a wide range of interesting people; it’s Rye Lane at its best.</p>

<p>There’s more to come from these two, including a sister cocktail bar in Peckham. Keep up with them here → <a href="https://twitter.com/alibabajuice">@alibabajuice</a>.</p>
