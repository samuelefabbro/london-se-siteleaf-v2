<p>Sitting next to Peckham Rye Station, Peckham Refreshment Rooms was started by Sven Mündner (of <a href="http://boldtendencies.com/">Bold Tendencies</a> and <a href="http://www.hannahbarry.com/">Hannah Barry Gallery</a>) and restaurateur, James Fisher. The pair were looking to create a place where people could come for a coffee and a croissant on their way to work and stop in for a bite to eat with friends on their way home.</p>

<p>The menu is seasonal and loosely based on a tapas style. As such, it’s worth ordering a few dishes to share between friends. Staple, tried and tested dishes include, aged parmesan with truffle honey (with cheese coming from <a href="http://www.lafromagerie.co.uk/">La Fromagerie</a>), as well as the breakfast option of Burford brown eggs with Alsace bacon or Merguez sausage. Alongside its succinct food menu, are the drinks options including beers from The Kernel, as well as French and Italian wines and a <em>grown-up</em> list of cocktails.</p>

<p>The building that houses the restaurant is part of the <em>Art Deco Quarter</em> of Peckham, and it’s clear that the materials used in the Refreshment Rooms have been selected to complement the space. The tenants of the deco building recently pitched in to renovate it and this investment has helped lift the look of this end of Blenheim Grove. This corner of Peckham has always been buzzing and the Refreshment Rooms have only added to the energy of the neighbourhood.</p>
