<p>This beautiful Victorian pub is a cosy retreat on the busy New Cross Road. It’s a great place for both a quiet drink after work, or a livelier evening on the weekend. The atmosphere is friendly, and you’ll often find people watching sport on the TV, alongside those quietly reading the newspaper and nursing a pint.</p>

<p>The food served here is definitely a cut above your average pub grub, yet is reasonably priced. Make sure to try the roast dinner on a Sunday — it has the perfect gravy-to-meat ratio.</p>

<p>As well as having a good selection of wines, The Albert also has an extensive choice of ales and ciders. The staff are always friendly and happy to recommend one of the ever-changing guest ales on offer.</p>
