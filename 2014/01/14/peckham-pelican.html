<p>Opened in August last year, the Peckham Pelican is an unfussy art/cinema/music space and bar which plays host to local artists and musicians. The decor is a bit of a shambles, with mis-matched wooden furniture, and fantastically chintzy ‘choose your own’ mugs hanging on the wall.</p>

<p>The Pelican serves decently priced pizzas, brimming with melted cheese; Brick Lane bagels and other treats. There’s also a  reasonably priced selection of wines and beers on offer, including ales from South East breweries, Meantime and Kernel and even Peckham’s own Brick Brewery — Brewed underneath Peckham Rye archways).</p>

<p>A stones throw from other gems such as South London Gallery, the Pelican is an exciting addition to this stretch of Peckham Road.</p>
