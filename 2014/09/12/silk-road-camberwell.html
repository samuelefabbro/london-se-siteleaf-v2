<p>As the name would suggest, this unprepossessing restaurant is packed full of spice. Locals and those in the know overlook the typically brash service in order to enjoy the strong and powerful flavours of the dishes on offer here.</p>

<p>The space itself is small — fitting mostly communal tables — so be prepared to get cosy alongside other customers. These tables are always full during evenings and weekends. It’s advisable to book early and to arrive on time, as staff like to keep a steady turnover of customers.</p>

<p>Be prepared to try new dishes. This is food from the Xinjiang province, and you won’t find any greasy chow mein here. Instead, be sure to try a few of the cold dishes including the fiery <em>shredded kelp</em>, or <em>cucumber in sauce</em>. It’s difficult to choose from the main dishes, as there are so many interesting options. We’d recommend trying the hot and sour <em>Yu-Shiang shredded pork</em> or the <em>Xinjiang Lamb Shish</em> skewers.</p>

<p>It’s pretty difficult to make a wrong choice here, and you’re bound to be happy with whichever choice you make. The dishes are well-priced and it’s definitely worth re-visiting so as to try as many dishes as possible.</p>
