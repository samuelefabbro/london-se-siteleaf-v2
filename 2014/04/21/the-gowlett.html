<p>Tucked away on a quiet residential street, a short walk from the Rye, is a friendly neighbourhood pub with pizzas, dogs and music. On entering, the bar looks like a traditional South London pub, with its dark wood panelled walls and well-worn, yet comfy furniture.</p>

<p>The Gowlett ‘belongs’ to the locals of the area, and is always a friendly place to pop in for a pizza and pint. On Thursdays, locals bring their own vinyl to ‘Lucky 7’s’ night, where each person awaits their 15 minutes of DJ fame.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest selling point of this pub however, is its pizza menu. Choose from the selection of thin-based, and topping-heavy pizzas, such as the ‘Gowlettini’, with goats cheese, prosciutto, pine nuts and rocket, and the Hawaiian – described on the menu as being “made in Peckham by Poles”, it has nothing much to do with Hawaii, really.</p>

<p>Come for the pizza, rotating selection of  ales, and to say hello to the landlord’s dog, Dallas.</p>
