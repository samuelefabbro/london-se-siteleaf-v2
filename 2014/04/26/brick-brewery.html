<p>Conveniently located under the arches of Peckham Rye station, Brick Brewery is proof of South East London’s high calibre of local breweries. Brewmaster and owner, Ian Stewart, began brewing at home a few years ago, and now supplies to a select number of local pubs on both sides of the river. All beer is brewed on site, often resulting in the smell of hops finding its way to commuters on the platforms above.</p>

<p>Open on Saturday afternoons, the taproom is filled with Handmade furniture and stripped and clean white walls, making for a friendly and unprepossessing space. The front patio has recently opened for the summer, and is a welcome addition to this exciting stretch of Blenheim Grove, which sadly, is under threat of an <a href="http://www.peckhamvision.org/wiki/Peckham_Rye_Station_Gateway">unsympathetic redesign of the space by Network Rail</a>.</p>

<p>We’re big fans of the American-style Pioneer IPA and Archway Steam. Ian has also mastered the Czech Pilsner, Bavarian wheat beer and, of course, the English bitter. There is quite the output being produced in this small archway and we look forward to seeing Brick becoming a staple across London.</p>
