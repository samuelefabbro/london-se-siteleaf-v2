<p>Perhaps the worst-kept secret in South East London, Frank’s and their partner, the Bold Tendencies art project, have helped kickstart the surrounding area’s growing creative scene. Since 2007, this formally disused car park is now home to Frank’s cafe and bar, and Bold Tendencies’ sculpture park. 
Once you’ve navigated your way up the interesting-smelling stairwells of this multi-story car park, you’ll get to the 6th floor. It’s here where you’ll find Bold Tendencies’ sculptures and art installations. For 2014, they’ve commissioned <a href="http://www.london-se.com/whats-on/the-right-to-flight/">Right to Flight</a> in which artist <a href="http://booktwo.org/">James Bridle</a> will fly a military-grade balloon from the roof. It’s also worth checking their <a href="http://frankscafe.org.uk/events">website</a> for upcoming events including orchestral performances.</p>

<p>Open during the summer months, Frank’s 2014’s menu (by chef and homegrown Peckham talent, <a href="https://twitter.com/ChefAmirPem">Amir Pem</a>), looks perfect for balmy summer evenings. The drinks menu is equally as appetising, and includes a range of cocktails, Meantime beers, and house wine sold by the glass and bottle.</p>

<p>The view from the top of the multi-story car park, where Frank’s is located, is impressive, and might be reason alone to go, as the skyline seems endless on a clear day. All of this now attracts big eclectic crowds ranging from city bankers, to the usual trendy ‘Peckham-ites’. As a result, weekend queues can become long so it’s a good idea to go early.</p>
