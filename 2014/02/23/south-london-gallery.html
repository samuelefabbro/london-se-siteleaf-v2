<p>First opened as The ‘South London Fine Arts Gallery’ in 1891, the gallery today plays host to a wide range of international contemporary artists. Past exhibitions have included works from artists such as Tom Friedman, Eva Rothschild, Tracey Emin and Anish Kapoor amongst others.</p>

<p>The gallery itself is split over two floors. The ground floor houses the main exhibition hall where larger scale works are shown. Tracey Emin’s tent, Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995 was shown here. Two smaller exhibition rooms are found in the Victorian terrace next door.</p>

<p>The gallery has recently purchased the neighbouring terraced house in order to build the cafe, <a href="http://number67.co.uk/">No.67</a>, as well as the Clore Studio, in which education and art outreach workshops take place.</p>

<p>With its free admission, as well as its local outreach programs, The South London Gallery is a valued asset to the local area. The cafe, although expensive, serves a great coffee and a mean bourbon-syrup waffle.</p>
