<p>Perched on top of the colonnade opposite Forest Hill Station, is what feels like a small piece of Cornwall. With its little tea-room front exterior, covered in twisted vines of wisteria growing around the door, St. David is a great place to spend a Sunday morning reading the newspaper and enjoy a loose leaf tea or Square Mile coffee in an antique cup and saucer.</p>
