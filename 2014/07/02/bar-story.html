<p>Set beneath a rumbling Peckham Rye Station railway arch, Bar Story is a gem set off the grubby and bustling Rye Lane. The interior is filled with long rows of communal tables and mis-matched chairs. A fire pit with railway sleeper seating can be found out the front.</p>

<p>On offer, is an extensive (and cheap!) cocktail menu as well as decently priced food. Try the happy hour from 6-7pm everyday and get 2 cocktails for £7. On the menu, are samplings such as burgers from local butcher Flock and Herd, and plenty of offers including 2 pizzas for £10 on Tuesday nights.</p>

<p>In keeping with Peckham’s proximity to Camberwell College of Art, many of the bars in the area are full with a younger crowd; Bar Story is no exception. It’s a favourite with the students who gather around the fire pits out the front during the winter, and overflow into the car park out the back during the warmer months.</p>

<p>Bar Story is a long-standing institution in Peckham, having being open since 2003. Bar Story, along with other businesses in the area surrounding Peckham Rye station, are under threat due to <a href="http://www.spectacle.co.uk/spectacleblog/peckham/the-peckham-rye-lane-station-gateway-redevelopment-project-by-network-rail/">redevelopment by Network Rail</a>.</p>
