<p>Hidden on a quiet residential street next to Burgess Park, is the newly opened Fowlds Cafe. Funded by the local residents of Addington Square, the cafe serves the neighbourhood from the front of <a href="http://www.avfowlds.co.uk/">A.V. Fowlds &amp; Sons</a> upholsterers who have operated on site since 1926.</p>

<p>The cafe is a collaboration with the upholsterers who, while struggling with the recession, were approached by the prospective cafe owners about using the front of the workshop to bring more custom to both businesses.</p>

<p>Residents of Addington Square themselves, the now cafe owners have adorned the space with flowers, art works and the usual cafe sundries, all while keeping the workshop vibe. The space is small, however, there’s room to sit outside and admire the exterior, complete with original upholsterers’ signage hanging from the front. You’ll most likely meet the resident and friendly cat, Toby.</p>

<p>Fowlds do a great <a href="http://shop.squaremilecoffee.com/">Square Mile</a> coffee alongside a daily changing menu of sandwiches, cakes and pastries. Don’t miss the Camberwell Carrot Cake, or freshly made salads and be sure to try the newly added cheese and cold meat boards that are now available on the weekends.</p>
