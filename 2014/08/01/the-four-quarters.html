<p>As a result of spending the majority of their childhood and awkward teen years playing arcade and video games, one half of London SE was understandably excited when the news came that a retro arcade game bar was opening up on Rye Lane in Peckham. The other half was excited by the prospect of a bar that has a food menu which—at the time of writing—solely comprises of grilled cheese sandwiches. Try the ‘Classic’ – cheddar, mozzarella, gruyere, ham and mustard.</p>

<p>Opened by friends, a couple of whom are owners of the shop <a href="http://www.retrogamebase.co.uk/">Retro Games Base</a> in Streatham, The Four Quarters is a bar centred around the machines. There are some real classics like Pac Man, Defender and Galaxian, some 90’s fighters in WWF WrestleFest and Street Fighter II Alpha, as well as a couple of pin ball machines. Apart from pinball, which will set you back a pound, the machines take American quarters. You can exchange four quarters (hence the name) for a pound at the bar.</p>

<p>With the wide selection of local and craft beers, and the collection of VHS films to watch on the projector, its a great place to hang, even for those not heavily into gaming.</p>
