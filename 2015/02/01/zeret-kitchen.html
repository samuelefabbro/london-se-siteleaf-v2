<p>Set underneath the imposing Castle Mead Estate tower block in Camberwell, is Zeret Kitchen; a friendly and family-run Ethiopian restaurant. The main focus here, is on hospitality. Owner, Tafe, and her family are warm and welcoming hosts who have owned Zeret Kitchen for close to ten years. They are more than happy to talk customers through the northern Ethiopian choices on the menu.</p>

<p>Tafe and her husband recommend the <em>Zeret Surprise</em> to those who are new to Ethiopian cuisine. This large sharing plate includes staples such as: kitfo (chopped beef with butter and mitmita spices), shuro (roasted powdered chickpeas), lega tibs (lamb), yebeg fit fit (mild lamb stew) and salad, all on top of a moist injera (flat bread). Thereâ€™s no need for cutlery, as the injera makes it easy  to scoop up the tasty flavours sitting on top!</p>

<p>Alongside the exciting food menu and warm hospitality, is the <em>Zeret coffee ceremony</em>, where guests are treated to a traditional experience. The beans are first roasted in a metal pan, then brewed in a pot, and finally served with popcorn and frankincense. Zeret Kitchen is a fantastic restaurant; both to those who are familiar to Ethiopian cuisine, as well as those who are new to it.</p>
