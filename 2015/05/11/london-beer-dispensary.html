<p>Located a stones throw from Crofton Park station, the London Beer Dispensary is another exciting addition to this stretch of Brockley Road.</p>

<p>Penge-based brewery, <a href="http://www.lateknightsbrewery.co.uk/">Late Knights</a>, have retained the features from <a href="http://www.london-se.com/spots/mr-lawrence/">Mr Lawrence</a> (the well-loved wine bar), who have thankfully not closed, but have just moved next door. The wood panelled rooms, Victorian fire place and patio garden have remained, but the bar itself has not.</p>

<p>In place of the traditional bar top, is a wooden barrel with six taps, kegs, and a fridge for bottled beers. The open layout makes for a relaxed atmosphere, where staff are happy to offer tasters and suggestions.</p>

<p>There are plenty of choices when it comes to beers and ciders here; eight ales, five ciders and six ever-changing keg lines. Choices aren’t only limited to Late Knights, as they also serve Brew By Numbers, Crate, and <a href="http://www.london-se.com/spots/brick-brewery/">Brick Brewery</a> amongst many others.</p>

<p>The food menu offers a similar amount of great choice. We’d recommend the Chicken Wings with BBQ Sauce, or one of the delicious burgers (try Voodoo Chile, with homemade chilli sauce).</p>

<p>This area of Crofton Park is slowly but surely developing a number of independent bars, restaurants and cafes, and it’s been nice to see the upward trend. Crofton Park seems to have a bright future ahead.</p>
